I've successfully implemented all three classes in the collective/visualization package following the
   architectural patterns established in the codebase:

  1. NetworkVisualization.java:
    - Visualizes the collective node network topology
    - Renders connections and information flow between nodes
    - Uses fractal visualization techniques to show system at multiple scales (macro, meso, micro)
    - Includes real-time updating and snapshot capabilities
    - Respects information boundaries with contextId enforcement
    - Analyzes network topologies to identify key structural properties
  2. InsightFlowMapper.java:
    - Visualizes how insights propagate and connect throughout the system
    - Generates flow maps showing journey of insights through transformations
    - Detects patterns across various dimensions (temporal, attribute, sequence)
    - Uses fractal mapping techniques to represent insight propagation at multiple scales
    - Provides filtering and focusing capabilities
    - Analyzes flow patterns to identify key insights
  3. EmergentPatternDisplay.java:
    - Visualizes detected patterns and their relationships
    - Renders emergent patterns using fractal visualization techniques
    - Shows self-similar structures at multiple scales (micro, meso, macro)
    - Generates fractal pattern visualizations with recursive layouts
    - Applies the Mandelbrot/Julia set concepts to pattern visualization
    - Analyzes pattern relationships to identify clusters and common themes

  All implementations follow the established architectural patterns including:
  - Fractal organizing principles applying the z = zÂ² + c formula
  - Multi-scale operations (micro, meso, macro levels)
  - Context-based information boundaries
  - Thread-safe concurrent data structures
  - Immutable views for safe data access
  - Clear separation of concerns with focused responsibilities

  These visualization components complete the collective package, providing the visual representation
  layer for the system's analysis, processing, communication, and memory components.
