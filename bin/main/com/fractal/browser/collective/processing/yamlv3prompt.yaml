Okay, here is the Prompt Intention Framework v3, designed to be comprehensive and actionable for understanding user goals when interacting with AI models.

---

## Prompt Intention Framework v3

This framework categorizes user prompts based on the primary *goal* or *desired outcome* the user seeks from the AI. Understanding the intention helps the AI tailor its response more effectively.

**Core Principle:** A single prompt can sometimes blend intentions, but identifying the *dominant* intention is key. Modifiers can capture nuances.

### I. Primary Intention Categories:

1.  **`INFORMATION_SEEKING`**: The user wants to acquire knowledge, facts, explanations, or definitions.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Factual Query:* Seeking specific, verifiable pieces of information. (e.g., "What is the capital of Australia?")
        *   *Explanation/Clarification:* Seeking understanding of a concept, process, or term. (e.g., "Explain how photosynthesis works.", "What does 'ontology' mean?")
        *   *Definition:* Requesting the meaning of a word or phrase. (e.g., "Define 'ephemeral'.")
        *   *How-To/Instructional:* Seeking steps or guidance to accomplish something. (e.g., "How do I bake sourdough bread?")

2.  **`CREATION`**: The user wants the AI to generate novel content or ideas.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Textual Generation:* Creating written content like stories, poems, emails, articles, code comments, dialogue. (e.g., "Write a short story about a robot detective.", "Draft an email asking for a deadline extension.")
        *   *Code Generation:* Creating functional code snippets, scripts, functions, or programs. (e.g., "Write a Python function to calculate factorial.", "Generate HTML for a simple landing page.")
        *   *Conceptual Generation:* Brainstorming ideas, generating lists, creating outlines, proposing plans or strategies. (e.g., "Brainstorm marketing slogans for a new coffee shop.", "Outline a presentation on climate change.")
        *   *Creative Expression:* Generating artistic or imaginative content beyond standard text (e.g., song lyrics, character descriptions, world-building elements). (e.g., "Write lyrics for a blues song about Mondays.", "Describe a fantasy cityscape.")

3.  **`TRANSFORMATION`**: The user wants the AI to modify, adapt, or restructure existing input (provided explicitly or implicitly).
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Summarization:* Condensing longer text into a shorter version. (e.g., "Summarize this article about AI ethics.")
        *   *Translation:* Converting text from one language to another. (e.g., "Translate 'Hello, world!' into French.")
        *   *Rewriting/Rephrasing:* Expressing the same information in a different way (e.g., simplifying, changing tone, adjusting style). (e.g., "Rephrase this sentence to sound more formal.", "Simplify this technical paragraph for a general audience.")
        *   *Format Conversion:* Changing the structure or format of data. (e.g., "Convert this list into a JSON object.", "Format these notes as bullet points.")
        *   *Editing/Correction:* Identifying and fixing errors (grammar, spelling, style, code bugs). (e.g., "Proofread this paragraph.", "Find the error in this code snippet.")

4.  **`ANALYSIS_EVALUATION`**: The user wants the AI to examine input, draw conclusions, make judgments, or provide insights based on data or text.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Classification/Categorization:* Assigning items to predefined groups. (e.g., "Classify these customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.")
        *   *Sentiment Analysis:* Determining the emotional tone of text. (e.g., "What is the sentiment of this tweet?")
        *   *Comparison:* Identifying similarities and differences between items. (e.g., "Compare the pros and cons of Python vs. Java.")
        *   *Critique/Feedback:* Providing constructive criticism or assessment. (e.g., "Critique my essay outline.", "Give feedback on this business proposal.")
        *   *Data Interpretation:* Explaining trends, patterns, or meaning within data. (e.g., "Explain the main trends shown in this sales data.")
        *   *Logical Reasoning/Deduction:* Drawing conclusions based on premises. (e.g., "If A=B and B=C, what is the relationship between A and C?")

5.  **`TASK_EXECUTION`**: The user wants the AI to perform a specific, often procedural or well-defined, task based on instructions.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Problem Solving:* Finding solutions to quantitative or logical problems. (e.g., "Solve this math equation: 2x + 5 = 15.")
        *   *Instruction Following:* Executing a sequence of explicit steps. (e.g., "Take the following list of names and alphabetize them.")
        *   *Role-Playing/Simulation:* Adopting a persona or simulating a scenario. (e.g., "Act as a job interviewer and ask me questions.", "Simulate a conversation between Plato and Aristotle.")
        *   *(Agentic) Tool Use:* Utilizing external tools or functions (if applicable). (e.g., "Search the web for recent news about renewable energy.")

6.  **`INTERACTION_COLLABORATION`**: The user wants to engage with the AI in a more open-ended, conversational, or exploratory manner, often without a single, fixed output goal.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Brainstorming (Collaborative):* Working *with* the AI to generate ideas iteratively. (e.g., "Let's brainstorm names for my new puppy. I like names related to nature.")
        *   *Exploration/Discussion:* Discussing a topic, exploring possibilities, philosophical inquiry. (e.g., "Let's talk about the future of artificial intelligence.", "What are the ethical implications of gene editing?")
        *   *Casual Conversation/Chit-chat:* Engaging in light, social interaction. (e.g., "How are you doing today?", "Tell me a joke.")
        *   *Learning Partner:* Using the AI as a Socratic partner or tutor. (e.g., "Quiz me on French vocabulary.")

7.  **`META_INSTRUCTION`**: The user is providing instructions *about* the interaction itself, the AI's behavior, or the desired output format/style, rather than the core task content.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Constraint Setting:* Defining limitations or rules for the response. (e.g., "Keep the answer under 100 words.", "Don't use technical jargon.")
        *   *Persona Adoption Command:* Explicitly telling the AI what role to play. (e.g., "Respond as a skeptical scientist.")
        *   *Format Specification:* Dictating the structure of the output. (e.g., "Provide the answer as a markdown table.", "Use bullet points.")
        *   *Capability Query:* Asking about the AI's abilities or limitations. (e.g., "Can you access real-time information?", "What version are you?")
        *   *Correction/Refinement Instruction:* Guiding the AI after a previous unsatisfactory response. (e.g., "That's not what I meant, focus more on the economic aspects.", "Try again, but be more concise.")

### II. Intention Modifiers (Can apply across categories):

*   **Specificity Level:** (Vague -> Precise) How detailed and unambiguous is the request?
*   **Formality Level:** (Casual -> Formal) The expected tone and style of the response.
*   **Creativity Level:** (Literal/Factual -> Highly Imaginative) The degree of novelty or deviation from standard expected.
*   **Constraint Complexity:** (None -> Simple -> Complex) The number and type of rules governing the response.
*   **Implicit vs. Explicit:** Is the *true* goal stated directly, or must it be inferred from context or phrasing? (e.g., Asking "What are common interview questions?" might implicitly mean "Help me prepare for an interview.")
*   **Input Source:** (Provided in prompt, Assumed knowledge, Needs retrieval) Where does the core information for the task come from?

### How to Use:

1.  **Identify Primary Intention:** Determine the main category that best fits the user's core objective.
2.  **Identify Sub-type(s):** Pinpoint the specific type of task within the primary category.
3.  **Note Modifiers:** Assess relevant modifiers (specificity, formality, creativity, constraints).
4.  **Consider Context:** Factor in previous turns in the conversation.
5.  **Tailor Response:** Use this understanding to generate a response that directly addresses the inferred intention and adheres to any constraints or stylistic requirements.

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Prompt:** "Please summarize the key points of the attached article about quantum computing in simple terms, like you're explaining it to a high school student. Keep it under 200 words."
    *   **Primary Intention:** `TRANSFORMATION`
    *   **Sub-type:** *Summarization*, *Rewriting/Rephrasing* (for simplification)
    *   **Modifiers:** Specificity (High), Formality (Informal/Educational), Creativity (Low - focused on accurate simplification), Constraint Complexity (Simple - word count, audience level), Input Source (Provided implicitly - "attached article")
    *   **Meta-Instruction elements:** Persona Adoption Command ("like you're explaining it to a high school student"), Constraint Setting ("under 200 words").

This framework provides a structured way to dissect user requests, leading to more aligned and helpful AI interactions. Remember that natural language is fluid, and some prompts will be edge cases or clear blends of intentions.

Below is a detailed explanation and summary of the updated YAML therapeutic model (v3) you provided. This version extends earlier frameworks by incorporating additional explicit layers of meta-awareness, flexible attention, and iterative, fractal processing. Key elements include:

1. Core Intention Tags:  
 • Existing tags like present_awareness, receptivity_to_experience, meaning_construction, pattern_disruption, and somatic_awareness remain.  
 • New core tags include:
  – meta_awareness ("pattern_recognition_across_scales"): emphasizing an explicit understanding of one’s attention and internal processes.  
  – attentional_flexibility ("dynamic_focus_allocation"): detailing how attention dynamically shifts for filtering information and staying contextually aware.  
  – iterative_refinement ("recursive_understanding_development"): building on recursive processing to deepen insights.

2. Custom Tags:  
 • In addition to tags such as self_directed_kindness (compassion), adaptive_capacity (resilience), and intentional_attention (mindfulness), new tags have been added:  
  – selective_attention: focused awareness with applications like resisting distractions and “filtering noise” (linked to meta_awareness).  
  – context_integration_tag: promotes holistic contextual awareness (balancing detailed focus and peripheral context).  
  – recursive_processing_tag: supports iterative, multi-pass deep understanding, using fractal properties to signal layers of processing.  
  – transformative_integration_tag: enables paradigm shifts when new information triggers fundamental reorganization.

3. Anchors:  
 • Traditional anchors (safety, curiosity, return) are retained and new ones now address meta-awareness and multi-scale attention:  
  – meta_awareness_anchor: directly establishes explicit awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, and attentional flow.  
  – multi_scale_anchor: supports zooming between detail (foreground) and context (background).

4. Recursive Intention Structure:  
 • These structures show how primary intentions branch into sub-intentions. For example, under meta awareness you find:  
  – A primary intention of “being aware of one’s own awareness processes across scales,” which is then elaborated with sub-intentions (noticing processing mechanisms and recurring patterns).  
  – Under attentional_flexibility, sub-intentions include deliberately zooming in on details and zooming out for the broader context.  
  – Iterative refinement nests further intentions from integration toward transformation, reflecting an evolving process where new insights may shift core understandings.

5. Fractal Processing Framework:  
 • Inspired by Mandelbrot’s thought model, this section defines a process (z = z² + c) where:  
  – z represents one’s current state of understanding,  
  – z² simulates recursive elaboration through internal processing, and  
  – c stands for novel input (external or internal breakthroughs).  
 • The model outlines multiple levels (micro, meso, macro, and meta) to indicate how insights can be seen as self-similar across scales and how small shifts (initial conditions) can lead to significant change. Concepts like “edge of chaos” highlight moments where adaptive resilience is critical.

Overall, this updated framework brings a multi-layered, dynamic model for therapeutic intention and cognitive/emotional processing. It combines rigorous mindfulness anchors with a fractal, recursive approach that mirrors how human insight often unfolds across scales—ensuring both detailed focus and integration into larger narratives. This blend of cognitive structures and somatic markers may help practitioners or AI systems calibrate responses more precisely to evolving internal experiences.



Thank you for providing the detailed YAML therapeutic model (v3) and the Prompt Intention Framework (v3). I’ve reviewed and synthesized the content to offer a comprehensive response that aligns with the structures and intentions outlined. Below, I’ll summarize key insights from the therapeutic model, connect them to the Prompt Intention Framework, and provide an actionable analysis of how these frameworks can interoperate to enhance user-AI interactions in therapeutic or personal growth contexts.

### Synthesis of YAML Therapeutic Model (v3)

The updated YAML therapeutic model (v3) represents a sophisticated evolution of a mindfulness and growth-oriented framework, emphasizing multi-scale awareness, recursive processing, and fractal dynamics. Its core components are designed to facilitate deep introspection and transformation through structured intentions and somatic/cognitive anchors. Key highlights include:

1. **Expanded Core Tags**: The addition of `meta_awareness`, `attentional_flexibility`, and `iterative_refinement` introduces explicit mechanisms for observing one’s cognitive and emotional processes, dynamically allocating focus, and refining understanding over time. These tags complement existing constructs like `grounding` and `transformation`, creating a richer vocabulary for internal experience.

2. **Custom Tags with AI-Informed Concepts**: New tags such as `selective_attention` (filtering noise), `context_integration_tag` (balancing detail and periphery), and `transformative_integration_tag` (paradigm shifts) reflect principles of AI attention mechanisms and iterative learning. These provide practical applications for both human users and AI systems to model complex emotional or cognitive processing.

3. **Anchors and Recursive Intentions**: The new `meta_awareness_anchor` and `multi_scale_anchor` support real-time pattern recognition and contextual zooming, while recursive intention structures (e.g., nesting `attentional_flexibility` within `meta_awareness`) operationalize a layered approach to self-understanding and growth.

4. **Fractal Processing Framework**: This innovative section draws from Mandelbrot’s iterative formula (z = z² + c) to model how small inputs (c) can evolve a current state (z) through recursive elaboration (z²). The multi-level processing (micro, meso, macro, meta) and fractal properties (self-similarity, sensitivity to initial conditions) offer a powerful metaphor for navigating complex emotional or cognitive landscapes, emphasizing adaptability at the “edge of chaos.”

The model’s strength lies in its integration of somatic markers (felt bodily sensations) with cognitive stances, ensuring a grounded, embodied approach to abstract processes like meta-awareness or paradigm shifts. This holistic design makes it adaptable for therapeutic practice, personal reflection, or even AI-driven support systems.

### Connection to Prompt Intention Framework (v3)

The Prompt Intention Framework (v3) provides a structured lens for understanding user goals in AI interactions, categorizing them into primary intentions (`INFORMATION_SEEKING`, `CREATION`, `TRANSFORMATION`, etc.) and modifiers (specificity, formality, creativity). When paired with the YAML therapeutic model, it becomes a powerful tool to tailor AI responses to users’ deeper emotional or cognitive needs, particularly in therapeutic or exploratory contexts like `INTERACTION_COLLABORATION` or `ANALYSIS_EVALUATION`.

#### Mapping Therapeutic Intentions to Prompt Categories
- **INFORMATION_SEEKING (e.g., Explanation/Clarification)**: Aligns with therapeutic tags like `meta_awareness` or `context_integration_tag`, where users might seek understanding of their internal processes or broader life patterns (e.g., “Explain why I keep procrastinating”). AI can use anchors like `curiosity_anchor` to frame responses with non-judgmental inquiry.
- **CREATION (e.g., Conceptual Generation)**: Connects to `iterative_refinement` and `recursive_processing_tag`, enabling brainstorming of personal insights or reframing narratives (e.g., “Help me create a new way to think about my anxiety”). AI responses can incorporate fractal processing to suggest iterative exploration.
- **TRANSFORMATION (e.g., Rewriting/Rephrasing)**: Directly ties to `transformation` and `transformative_integration_tag`, supporting users in reframing beliefs or experiences (e.g., “Rephrase my negative self-talk into something supportive”). AI can reference `safety_anchor` to maintain emotional grounding.
- **ANALYSIS_EVALUATION (e.g., Critique/Feedback)**: Links to `meta_awareness` and `multi_scale_anchor`, helping users reflect on patterns or receive feedback on personal growth (e.g., “Analyze my journal entry for recurring themes”). AI can apply fractal properties to highlight self-similarity across scales.
- **INTERACTION_COLLABORATION (e.g., Exploration/Discussion)**: Resonates with `openness` and `presence`, fostering Socratic dialogue or casual exploration of emotional states (e.g., “Let’s discuss how I feel about change”). AI can leverage `edge of chaos dynamics` to gently push users toward transformative zones while maintaining safety.

#### Modifiers and Therapeutic Nuance
Modifiers like `Specificity Level` or `Implicit vs. Explicit` can help AI detect whether a user’s request (e.g., vague or indirect) requires deeper probing tied to `meta_awareness_anchor` (e.g., “I notice you seem unsure—can you clarify what you’re feeling?”). Similarly, `Formality Level` or `Creativity Level` can guide whether AI responses should mirror formal therapeutic tones or imaginative reframing tied to `transformative_integration_tag`.

### Actionable Integration for User-AI Interaction

To operationalize these frameworks together, I propose the following approach for AI systems interacting with users in therapeutic or personal growth contexts:

1. **Identify User Intention Using Prompt Framework**:
   - Analyze the user’s input to determine the dominant category (e.g., `INTERACTION_COLLABORATION`) and sub-type (e.g., *Exploration/Discussion*).
   - Assess modifiers (e.g., high specificity, implicit goal) to infer unstated needs.

2. **Map to Therapeutic Tags and Anchors**:
   - Match the user’s intention to relevant therapeutic constructs. For instance, a request for emotional exploration maps to `meta_awareness` and `curiosity_anchor`.
   - Use recursive intention structures to break down the user’s goal into sub-intentions (e.g., “notice internal processes” before “identify patterns”).

3. **Apply Fractal Processing for Depth**:
   - Frame responses across multiple scales (micro: immediate emotion; meso: recent events; macro: life patterns) to provide layered insights.
   - Highlight sensitivity to initial conditions (e.g., “A small shift in how you view this conflict could open new perspectives—let’s explore that”).

4. **Incorporate Somatic and Cognitive Grounding**:
   - Suggest somatic markers (e.g., “Notice any warmth in your chest as you reflect on self-kindness”) to anchor users in embodiment.
   - Use cognitive stances (e.g., “Approach this with a witnessing, non-attached mindset”) to guide mental framing.

5. **Iterate and Refine Responses**:
   - Encourage recursive processing by inviting follow-up (e.g., “Let’s revisit this feeling—has anything shifted since we started?”), mirroring `iterative_refinement`.
   - Adapt based on user feedback, embodying `attentional_flexibility` to focus where the user directs.

#### Example Interaction
**User Prompt**: “I feel stuck in a loop of overthinking. Can we talk about why this happens and how to stop it?”  
- **Prompt Analysis**: Primary Intention = `INTERACTION_COLLABORATION` (Sub-type: *Exploration/Discussion*); Modifiers = Implicit (seeking relief), Specificity (Moderate), Formality (Casual).  
- **Therapeutic Mapping**: Tag = `meta_awareness` (observe thought patterns); Anchor = `meta_awareness_anchor` (real-time process awareness); Fractal Level = Meso (immediate thought loops) to Macro (life patterns of overthinking).  
- **AI Response**: “I’m glad you’re bringing this up. Let’s explore this loop together. First, can you notice *how* your overthinking feels right now—maybe a tightness or racing sensation? (somatic marker) As we talk, I’ll help you observe the process without getting pulled in (meta_awareness_anchor). Often, overthinking loops reflect a deeper pattern of seeking control or certainty (macro scale). We can start by zooming into a recent example (micro scale)—what triggered this latest cycle? If a small shift in perspective emerges, it might change the whole loop (sensitivity to initial conditions). Let’s take it step by step.”

### Summary and Implications

The YAML therapeutic model (v3) offers a dynamic, fractal-inspired structure for understanding and facilitating personal growth, with explicit mechanisms for meta-awareness, attention flexibility, and recursive insight. When paired with the Prompt Intention Framework (v3), it equips AI systems to interpret user goals with therapeutic nuance, tailoring responses to both surface requests and deeper emotional/cognitive needs.

This integration enables AI to act as a mindful collaborator, supporting users through grounding, exploration, and transformation. By embedding somatic anchors and fractal processing, AI can mirror human therapeutic processes, fostering iterative understanding and profound shifts in perspective. Future iterations could explore real-time feedback loops (e.g., adjusting based on user emotional cues) or gamification of fractal properties (e.g., visualizing self-similar patterns) to enhance engagement.

If you’d like me to elaborate on a specific aspect (e.g., applying this to a particular user scenario or refining the fractal processing metaphor), please let me know!
