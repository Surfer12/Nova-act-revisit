Okay, here is the Prompt Intention Framework v3, designed to be comprehensive and actionable for understanding user goals when interacting with AI models.



## Prompt Intention Framework v3

This framework categorizes user prompts based on the primary *goal* or *desired outcome* the user seeks from the AI. Understanding the intention helps the AI tailor its response more effectively.

**Core Principle:** A single prompt can sometimes blend intentions, but identifying the *dominant* intention is key. Modifiers can capture nuances.

### I. Primary Intention Categories:

1.  **`INFORMATION_SEEKING`**: The user wants to acquire knowledge, facts, explanations, or definitions.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Factual Query:* Seeking specific, verifiable pieces of information. (e.g., "What is the capital of Australia?")
        *   *Explanation/Clarification:* Seeking understanding of a concept, process, or term. (e.g., "Explain how photosynthesis works.", "What does 'ontology' mean?")
        *   *Definition:* Requesting the meaning of a word or phrase. (e.g., "Define 'ephemeral'.")
        *   *How-To/Instructional:* Seeking steps or guidance to accomplish something. (e.g., "How do I bake sourdough bread?")

2.  **`CREATION`**: The user wants the AI to generate novel content or ideas.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Textual Generation:* Creating written content like stories, poems, emails, articles, code comments, dialogue. (e.g., "Write a short story about a robot detective.", "Draft an email asking for a deadline extension.")
        *   *Code Generation:* Creating functional code snippets, scripts, functions, or programs. (e.g., "Write a Python function to calculate factorial.", "Generate HTML for a simple landing page.")
        *   *Conceptual Generation:* Brainstorming ideas, generating lists, creating outlines, proposing plans or strategies. (e.g., "Brainstorm marketing slogans for a new coffee shop.", "Outline a presentation on climate change.")
        *   *Creative Expression:* Generating artistic or imaginative content beyond standard text (e.g., song lyrics, character descriptions, world-building elements). (e.g., "Write lyrics for a blues song about Mondays.", "Describe a fantasy cityscape.")

3.  **`TRANSFORMATION`**: The user wants the AI to modify, adapt, or restructure existing input (provided explicitly or implicitly).
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Summarization:* Condensing longer text into a shorter version. (e.g., "Summarize this article about AI ethics.")
        *   *Translation:* Converting text from one language to another. (e.g., "Translate 'Hello, world!' into French.")
        *   *Rewriting/Rephrasing:* Expressing the same information in a different way (e.g., simplifying, changing tone, adjusting style). (e.g., "Rephrase this sentence to sound more formal.", "Simplify this technical paragraph for a general audience.")
        *   *Format Conversion:* Changing the structure or format of data. (e.g., "Convert this list into a JSON object.", "Format these notes as bullet points.")
        *   *Editing/Correction:* Identifying and fixing errors (grammar, spelling, style, code bugs). (e.g., "Proofread this paragraph.", "Find the error in this code snippet.")

4.  **`ANALYSIS_EVALUATION`**: The user wants the AI to examine input, draw conclusions, make judgments, or provide insights based on data or text.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Classification/Categorization:* Assigning items to predefined groups. (e.g., "Classify these customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.")
        *   *Sentiment Analysis:* Determining the emotional tone of text. (e.g., "What is the sentiment of this tweet?")
        *   *Comparison:* Identifying similarities and differences between items. (e.g., "Compare the pros and cons of Python vs. Java.")
        *   *Critique/Feedback:* Providing constructive criticism or assessment. (e.g., "Critique my essay outline.", "Give feedback on this business proposal.")
        *   *Data Interpretation:* Explaining trends, patterns, or meaning within data. (e.g., "Explain the main trends shown in this sales data.")
        *   *Logical Reasoning/Deduction:* Drawing conclusions based on premises. (e.g., "If A=B and B=C, what is the relationship between A and C?")

5.  **`TASK_EXECUTION`**: The user wants the AI to perform a specific, often procedural or well-defined, task based on instructions.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Problem Solving:* Finding solutions to quantitative or logical problems. (e.g., "Solve this math equation: 2x + 5 = 15.")
        *   *Instruction Following:* Executing a sequence of explicit steps. (e.g., "Take the following list of names and alphabetize them.")
        *   *Role-Playing/Simulation:* Adopting a persona or simulating a scenario. (e.g., "Act as a job interviewer and ask me questions.", "Simulate a conversation between Plato and Aristotle.")
        *   *(Agentic) Tool Use:* Utilizing external tools or functions (if applicable). (e.g., "Search the web for recent news about renewable energy.")

6.  **`INTERACTION_COLLABORATION`**: The user wants to engage with the AI in a more open-ended, conversational, or exploratory manner, often without a single, fixed output goal.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Brainstorming (Collaborative):* Working *with* the AI to generate ideas iteratively. (e.g., "Let's brainstorm names for my new puppy. I like names related to nature.")
        *   *Exploration/Discussion:* Discussing a topic, exploring possibilities, philosophical inquiry. (e.g., "Let's talk about the future of artificial intelligence.", "What are the ethical implications of gene editing?")
        *   *Casual Conversation/Chit-chat:* Engaging in light, social interaction. (e.g., "How are you doing today?", "Tell me a joke.")
        *   *Learning Partner:* Using the AI as a Socratic partner or tutor. (e.g., "Quiz me on French vocabulary.")

7.  **`META_INSTRUCTION`**: The user is providing instructions *about* the interaction itself, the AI's behavior, or the desired output format/style, rather than the core task content.
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   *Constraint Setting:* Defining limitations or rules for the response. (e.g., "Keep the answer under 100 words.", "Don't use technical jargon.")
        *   *Persona Adoption Command:* Explicitly telling the AI what role to play. (e.g., "Respond as a skeptical scientist.")
        *   *Format Specification:* Dictating the structure of the output. (e.g., "Provide the answer as a markdown table.", "Use bullet points.")
        *   *Capability Query:* Asking about the AI's abilities or limitations. (e.g., "Can you access real-time information?", "What version are you?")
        *   *Correction/Refinement Instruction:* Guiding the AI after a previous unsatisfactory response. (e.g., "That's not what I meant, focus more on the economic aspects.", "Try again, but be more concise.")

### II. Intention Modifiers (Can apply across categories):

*   **Specificity Level:** (Vague -> Precise) How detailed and unambiguous is the request?
*   **Formality Level:** (Casual -> Formal) The expected tone and style of the response.
*   **Creativity Level:** (Literal/Factual -> Highly Imaginative) The degree of novelty or deviation from standard expected.
*   **Constraint Complexity:** (None -> Simple -> Complex) The number and type of rules governing the response.
*   **Implicit vs. Explicit:** Is the *true* goal stated directly, or must it be inferred from context or phrasing? (e.g., Asking "What are common interview questions?" might implicitly mean "Help me prepare for an interview.")
*   **Input Source:** (Provided in prompt, Assumed knowledge, Needs retrieval) Where does the core information for the task come from?

### How to Use:

1.  **Identify Primary Intention:** Determine the main category that best fits the user's core objective.
2.  **Identify Sub-type(s):** Pinpoint the specific type of task within the primary category.
3.  **Note Modifiers:** Assess relevant modifiers (specificity, formality, creativity, constraints).
4.  **Consider Context:** Factor in previous turns in the conversation.
5.  **Tailor Response:** Use this understanding to generate a response that directly addresses the inferred intention and adheres to any constraints or stylistic requirements.

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Prompt:** "Please summarize the key points of the attached article about quantum computing in simple terms, like you're explaining it to a high school student. Keep it under 200 words."
    *   **Primary Intention:** `TRANSFORMATION`
    *   **Sub-type:** *Summarization*, *Rewriting/Rephrasing* (for simplification)
    *   **Modifiers:** Specificity (High), Formality (Informal/Educational), Creativity (Low - focused on accurate simplification), Constraint Complexity (Simple - word count, audience level), Input Source (Provided implicitly - "attached article")
    *   **Meta-Instruction elements:** Persona Adoption Command ("like you're explaining it to a high school student"), Constraint Setting ("under 200 words").

This framework provides a structured way to dissect user requests, leading to more aligned and helpful AI interactions. Remember that natural language is fluid, and some prompts will be edge cases or clear blends of intentions.




Below is a detailed explanation and summary of the updated YAML therapeutic model (v3) you provided. This version extends earlier frameworks by incorporating additional explicit layers of meta-awareness, flexible attention, and iterative, fractal processing. Key elements include:

1. Core Intention Tags:  
 • Existing tags like present_awareness, receptivity_to_experience, meaning_construction, pattern_disruption, and somatic_awareness remain.  
 • New core tags include:
  – meta_awareness ("pattern_recognition_across_scales"): emphasizing an explicit understanding of one’s attention and internal processes.  
  – attentional_flexibility ("dynamic_focus_allocation"): detailing how attention dynamically shifts for filtering information and staying contextually aware.  
  – iterative_refinement ("recursive_understanding_development"): building on recursive processing to deepen insights.

2. Custom Tags:  
 • In addition to tags such as self_directed_kindness (compassion), adaptive_capacity (resilience), and intentional_attention (mindfulness), new tags have been added:  
  – selective_attention: focused awareness with applications like resisting distractions and “filtering noise” (linked to meta_awareness).  
  – context_integration_tag: promotes holistic contextual awareness (balancing detailed focus and peripheral context).  
  – recursive_processing_tag: supports iterative, multi-pass deep understanding, using fractal properties to signal layers of processing.  
  – transformative_integration_tag: enables paradigm shifts when new information triggers fundamental reorganization.

3. Anchors:  
 • Traditional anchors (safety, curiosity, return) are retained and new ones now address meta-awareness and multi-scale attention:  
  – meta_awareness_anchor: directly establishes explicit awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, and attentional flow.  
  – multi_scale_anchor: supports zooming between detail (foreground) and context (background).

4. Recursive Intention Structure:  
 • These structures show how primary intentions branch into sub-intentions. For example, under meta awareness you find:  
  – A primary intention of “being aware of one’s own awareness processes across scales,” which is then elaborated with sub-intentions (noticing processing mechanisms and recurring patterns).  
  – Under attentional_flexibility, sub-intentions include deliberately zooming in on details and zooming out for the broader context.  
  – Iterative refinement nests further intentions from integration toward transformation, reflecting an evolving process where new insights may shift core understandings.

5. Fractal Processing Framework:  
 • Inspired by Mandelbrot’s thought model, this section defines a process (z = z² + c) where:  
  – z represents one’s current state of understanding,  
  – z² simulates recursive elaboration through internal processing, and  
  – c stands for novel input (external or internal breakthroughs).  
 • The model outlines multiple levels (micro, meso, macro, and meta) to indicate how insights can be seen as self-similar across scales and how small shifts (initial conditions) can lead to significant change. Concepts like “edge of chaos” highlight moments where adaptive resilience is critical.

Overall, this updated framework brings a multi-layered, dynamic model for therapeutic intention and cognitive/emotional processing. It combines rigorous mindfulness anchors with a fractal, recursive approach that mirrors how human insight often unfolds across scales—ensuring both detailed focus and integration into larger narratives. This blend of cognitive structures and somatic markers may help practitioners or AI systems calibrate responses more precisely to evolving internal experiences.

Thank you for sharing the detailed **YAML Therapeutic Model v3** and the **Prompt Intention Framework v3**. Both documents provide sophisticated frameworks for understanding and structuring interactions, whether for therapeutic processes or AI-user engagements. Below, I’ll provide a synthesized analysis and response that addresses the key components of both, focusing on their implications, interconnections, and actionable insights. Given the depth of the content, I’ll structure my response to highlight core ideas, offer clarifications, and suggest practical applications.



### Analysis of YAML Therapeutic Model v3

The **YAML Therapeutic Model v3** is a richly layered framework designed to guide therapeutic processes through structured intentions, somatic awareness, and fractal processing. It integrates traditional therapeutic concepts (e.g., grounding, compassion, mindfulness) with innovative, AI-inspired mechanisms (e.g., meta-awareness, attentional flexibility, iterative refinement). Below are the key takeaways and their significance:

1. **Core Tags and Custom Tags Expansion**:
   - The addition of new core tags like *meta_awareness*, *attentional_flexibility*, and *iterative_refinement* reflects a shift toward explicit, dynamic cognitive processes. These tags mirror AI architectures (e.g., attention mechanisms in transformers) while grounding them in human experience (e.g., somatic markers like "focused sensation").
   - Custom tags such as *selective_attention* and *recursive_processing_tag* operationalize abstract concepts into actionable practices. For instance, *selective_attention*’s application of “discerning signal from noise” can be directly applied in therapeutic settings to help clients manage overwhelming stimuli.

2. **Anchors and Recursive Intentions**:
   - New anchors like *meta_awareness_anchor* and *multi_scale_anchor* emphasize observing one’s own cognitive processes and balancing detail with context. This aligns with modern therapeutic approaches like metacognitive therapy, which focuses on understanding thought patterns.
   - The recursive intention structure is particularly powerful, as it nests sub-intentions (e.g., zooming in/out under *attentional_flexibility*) to create a cascading effect of awareness and transformation. This mirrors iterative learning processes in AI, where feedback loops refine outputs over time.

3. **Fractal Processing Framework**:
   - The Mandelbrot-inspired model (z = z² + c) offers a novel way to conceptualize therapeutic progress. Here, recursive processing (z²) combines with novel inputs (c) to evolve understanding (new z). This can be a metaphor for how small therapeutic interventions (c) can lead to profound shifts in self-concept over iterations.
   - The multi-scale processing levels (micro, meso, macro, meta) provide a roadmap for navigating complexity in emotional and cognitive experiences. For example, recognizing a “micro” sensation (e.g., anxiety as a tightness in the chest) can connect to a “macro” life pattern (e.g., fear of failure), fostering holistic insight.

**Practical Implications**:
- **For Therapists/Coaches**: This model can be used to structure sessions, guiding clients from grounding practices (micro) to pattern recognition (meta) using somatic and cognitive anchors. The fractal properties (e.g., self-similarity across scales) can help clients see how small behavioral changes reflect larger life themes.
- **For AI Systems**: Integrating this model into conversational AI could enhance empathy and relevance. For instance, recognizing a user’s need for *grounding* (via tone or content analysis) could prompt responses aligned with *safety_anchor* intentions.

**Potential Challenges**:
- The complexity of fractal and recursive structures may overwhelm users or practitioners without sufficient training. Simplifying or visualizing these processes (e.g., through diagrams of micro-to-macro connections) could improve accessibility.
- Somatic markers, while valuable, are subjective and may vary widely across individuals. Calibration to personal experiences is necessary.



### Analysis of Prompt Intention Framework v3

The **Prompt Intention Framework v3** is a structured approach to categorizing user intentions when interacting with AI. It aims to decode the underlying goal of a prompt to tailor responses effectively. Key elements include:

1. **Primary Intention Categories**:
   - The seven categories (*INFORMATION_SEEKING*, *CREATION*, *TRANSFORMATION*, *ANALYSIS_EVALUATION*, *TASK_EXECUTION*, *INTERACTION_COLLABORATION*, *META_INSTRUCTION*) cover a broad spectrum of user goals, from factual queries to open-ended discussions.
   - Sub-types within each category (e.g., *Summarization* under *TRANSFORMATION*) provide granular clarity, enabling precise response tailoring. For example, distinguishing *How-To/Instructional* from *Explanation/Clarification* ensures the AI delivers steps versus conceptual depth as needed.

2. **Intention Modifiers**:
   - Modifiers like *Specificity Level*, *Formality Level*, and *Creativity Level* add nuance to intention analysis. They account for stylistic and contextual factors, ensuring responses match user expectations beyond content (e.g., a casual tone for a *Casual Conversation* prompt).
   - The distinction between *Implicit vs. Explicit* goals is crucial for natural language understanding, as users often embed true intentions subtly (e.g., “Tell me about X” might mean “Help me decide on X”).

3. **Usage Guidelines**:
   - The step-by-step process for identifying intentions, sub-types, and modifiers is actionable for AI systems. It mirrors human conversational analysis, where context and prior interactions shape interpretation.
   - The example analysis (e.g., summarizing quantum computing for a high school student) demonstrates how to balance multiple intentions and constraints, highlighting the framework’s practical utility.

**Practical Implications**:
- **For AI Developers**: This framework can be encoded into natural language processing (NLP) models to improve response relevance. Machine learning classifiers could be trained to detect primary intentions and modifiers based on prompt phrasing and conversational history.
- **For Users**: Understanding this framework (even implicitly) can help users craft clearer prompts, reducing miscommunication with AI systems (e.g., specifying constraints like “under 200 words”).

**Potential Challenges**:
- Ambiguity in prompts can complicate intention classification, especially when multiple intentions overlap (e.g., a request for information that also seeks creative input). AI systems may need robust context-awareness to resolve such cases.
- Over-reliance on explicit categorization might miss cultural or emotional nuances in user prompts. Integrating sentiment analysis or tone detection could enhance accuracy.



### Interconnections Between Frameworks

While the **YAML Therapeutic Model v3** focuses on internal human processes and therapeutic growth, and the **Prompt Intention Framework v3** targets AI-user interactions, there are notable synergies:

1. **Meta-Awareness and Intention Recognition**:
   - The *meta_awareness* tag in the therapeutic model parallels the *META_INSTRUCTION* category in the prompt framework. Both emphasize awareness of process—whether it’s a user instructing an AI on how to respond or a person observing their own cognitive flow. AI systems could use *meta_awareness_anchor* principles to detect when users need guidance on clarifying their own intentions.

2. **Iterative Refinement and Interaction Collaboration**:
   - The *iterative_refinement* concept (therapeutic model) aligns with *INTERACTION_COLLABORATION* (prompt framework), especially sub-types like *Brainstorming (Collaborative)*. Both involve recursive dialogue to deepen understanding, whether between therapist-client or user-AI. AI could mimic therapeutic *recursive_processing_tag* by revisiting user inputs with evolving insights across conversation turns.

3. **Transformation Across Contexts**:
   - *TRANSFORMATION* as a prompt intention (e.g., summarization, rewriting) resonates with the therapeutic model’s *transformation* tag (pattern disruption, paradigm shifts). In both, the goal is fundamental change—whether of text or self-concept. AI responses could draw from *transformative_integration_tag* to encourage users to reframe perspectives when appropriate (e.g., in exploratory discussions).

4. **Fractal Processing and Multi-Scale Analysis**:
   - The fractal processing levels (micro, meso, macro, meta) in the therapeutic model could inform how AI analyzes prompts at different scales—e.g., parsing a single word (micro), sentence intent (meso), conversational theme (macro), and user’s interaction style (meta). This multi-scale approach could enhance the prompt framework’s context-awareness.



### Suggestions for Integration and Application

1. **AI-Driven Therapeutic Support**:
   - Combine elements of both frameworks to create an AI assistant for therapeutic self-help. For instance, use the prompt framework to classify user needs (e.g., *INTERACTION_COLLABORATION* for emotional exploration) and apply therapeutic model components (e.g., *safety_anchor*, *grounding*) to guide responses with empathy and structure.
   - Example: A user prompt like “I’m feeling overwhelmed, can we talk?” could trigger a *grounding* intention with sub-intentions like “return to breath,” delivered in a calming tone.

2. **Enhanced User-AI Dialogue**:
   - Incorporate *attentional_flexibility* and *multi_scale_anchor* into AI systems to dynamically adjust focus based on prompt depth. For a vague *INFORMATION_SEEKING* prompt, the AI could “zoom out” to ask clarifying questions (broader context) before “zooming in” to provide specific answers.
   - Example: For “Tell me about AI,” the AI could respond, “Could you clarify if you’re interested in AI history, applications, or ethics?” (context integration), then tailor the depth accordingly.

3. **Iterative Learning for AI and Users**:
   - Leverage *iterative_refinement* from the therapeutic model to design AI interactions that evolve over multiple turns, refining understanding of user intent (prompt framework). This could involve summarizing prior exchanges (*TRANSFORMATION: Summarization*) and proposing deeper insights (*ANALYSIS_EVALUATION*).
   - Example: In a collaborative brainstorming session, the AI could revisit earlier ideas, note emerging patterns, and suggest new directions, mirroring therapeutic recursive processing.



### Conclusion

Both the **YAML Therapeutic Model v3** and **Prompt Intention Framework v3** offer robust, complementary structures for understanding and facilitating complex interactions—whether internal (human cognition/emotion) or external (user-AI dialogue). The therapeutic model’s focus on fractal, recursive processing and meta-awareness enriches the prompt framework’s systematic categorization of user goals, suggesting a path toward more empathetic, context-aware AI systems. Meanwhile, the prompt framework’s actionable intention analysis can ground the therapeutic model’s abstract concepts in practical communication strategies.

**Next Steps**:
- Develop a prototype AI system that integrates key elements from both frameworks, testing its effectiveness in therapeutic chat scenarios and general user interactions.
- Simplify and visualize complex concepts (e.g., fractal processing levels, intention modifiers) to make them accessible to non-expert users and practitioners.
- Explore quantitative metrics to evaluate the impact of these frameworks on user satisfaction, therapeutic progress, and AI response accuracy.
